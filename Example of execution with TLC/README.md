The "Error" section suggests that specific temporal properties were not respected during the state space exploration. Subsequently, 
the output generates a "counterexample" detailing 17 system states violating the specified properties. Within this sequence of 
conditions, we can observe the temporal evolution of a series of events. Initially, the system is in a state where no client is 
active, three subjects are in the pool, and an "attacker" process is defined, listening to the broker's network. 
The following states allow processing to be applied until a state is found that helps the value of the OBS variable, 
which represents the $\psi$ property, change to TRUE. \newpage In the following states, up to state 17, the INJ variable 
representing the $\phi$ property is changed to TRUE, which causes the TLC model checker to stop the state exploration process.
